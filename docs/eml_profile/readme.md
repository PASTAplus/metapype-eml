## EDI EML Profile

An EML profile is a subset of the EML schema that EDI plans to support. the simplest way to convey this is a list of xpaths.

This dir contains:

1. this readme
1. CSV file with these columns:`concept_name, xpath, frequency`
`

- concept_name: 
- xpath: leaf nodes only. this draft was derived from a snapshot of all contributed datasets (LTER and EDI scopes) available in July 2019. So it reflects xpaths in use.
- frequency: count of instances of this xpath in all docs`
`


This is a first draft to see if the format is acceptable.
